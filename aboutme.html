    <p>Hey! my name is Anilla Stephannie a Stastiscianeconomist by profession a
       lover of cats who would kill herself to ensure their survial.Recentlly i joined moringa to have my thirst of
       coding quenched.The experience so far has been amazing!With pair peer teaching and an extensive cotent
      coupled with dedicated tech mentors ...i can never be more satisfied.
    while here at Moringa, I have learnt about how to use the command prompt terminal,
      Git and Github,the use of linux os and  two languages :</p>
     <ul>
       <li>HTML</li>With html,the hyper text markup language, i have lerant how to write  webpage like this one!
           using tags such p, ul,img,ul,and many more!
       <li>CSS</li>Css,Cascding style sheet, on the other hand is use to
       style and beautify a given html webpage using different selectors.
     </ul>
     <p>While learning i did small projects taht helped me understand
         the languages even better. For instance while learning how to code a
         webpage with html , i made my very <a href="https://github.com/Anillab/Hello-world.git">Hello world!</a>Later
         on with further advancement i learnt how to incorporate css with html this can be seen vividly in my page about
         <a href="https://github.com/Anillab/My-Fav-Animal.git">My Favourite Animal</a> here, aspects of class selectors
         and the cascading issue is practised. <br>
         
         As you've noticed, the links have taken you to my github repositories ,this is where i store my code publicly for anyone to
         see. With Github, since my code for instance My Favourite Animal,is saved there in a master branch,
          i can choose to copy the code and create mini barnches  where i can try out different sytling without
          messing  up with my original code besides, it allows more than  one programmer to work
          on a project simultenously and later compare and merge where possible;thus branching and merging in css. <br>
          One amazing thing i learnt too was the responsive design and meddia query . this is
          more user orientied since it allows as to resize the webpage in terms of pixels
           and place rules that would enable the
           better viewing of a website on different gadgets irrespective of  their size.
